# TP1: Machine Learning

Welcome to the TP1 Machine Learning project! This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and related resources for practical exercises and experiments in machine learning.

## About

This project is designed to support hands-on learning in machine learning. It includes examples, assignments, and notebook-based implementations covering key concepts, algorithms, and evaluation techniques.

**Topics may include:**
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering and selection
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Introduction to popular ML libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.)
