# TP1: Machine Learning

Welcome to the TP1 Machine Learning project!

## About

This project is designed to documment my learning in ML. It includes examples, assignments, and  my notebook-based implementations covering key concepts, algorithms, and evaluation techniques.

**Topics may include:**
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering and selection
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Model evaluation and metrics
- Introduction to popular ML libraries (Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc.)
